# Asynchronous Heterogeneous Linear Quadratic Regulator Design

This repository includes the Python codes to implement the experimental results of the following paper:

1) L. F. Toso*, H. Wang*, J. Anderson (2024). [Asynchronous Heterogeneous Linear Quadratic Regulator Design](https://github.com/jd-anderson/AsyncLQR/blob/main/Asynchronous%20LQR%20Design.pdf)

^* = equal contribution.

## Notation

To ease notation, in the paper we denote the step-size as $\eta$

## Instructions

To run the codes in this repository, you only need a working Jupyter installation.

## Troubleshooting

If you have any trouble running those codes or have any question about the paper, please email [Leonardo F. Toso](mailto:lt2879@columbia.edu).
